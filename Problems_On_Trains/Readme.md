# üöÜ Problems on Trains ‚Äì Concepts, Formulas, and Example Questions

## üìò Key Concepts & Formulas

### 1. Passing a Signal Post, Pole, or Standing Man
**Time to pass = Time to cover own length**  
**Formula:**  

Time = Length of Train (m) / Speed (m/s)


---

### 2. Passing a Stationary Object of Length (Platform, Engine)
**Time to pass = Time to cover sum of lengths**  
**Formula:**  

Time = Length of Train + Length of Object (m) / Speed (m/s)


---

### 3. Two Trains Moving in the Same Direction
**Relative Speed** (when $u > v$):  
Relative Speed = u - v

**Time for Faster Train to Cross Slower Train:**  
Time = Sum of Lengths (m) / Relative Speed (m/s)


---

### 4. Two Trains Moving in Opposite Directions
**Relative Speed:**  
Relative Speed = u + v

**Time to Cross Each Other:**  

Time = Sum of Lengths (m) / Relative Speed (m/s)


---

### 5. Speed Ratio After Crossing (Two Trains Start from Different Points)
If after crossing, they take $a$ and $b$ hours to reach their destinations:  

A's Speed : B's Speed = sqrt{b} : sqrt{a}


---

### 6. Speed Conversion  
To convert km/h to m/s:  

1 km/h * 5 / 18 m/s

## üìù Example Questions (All Types)

### Example 1: (Passing a Signal Post)
**Q:** A train 180 m long is running at 54 km/h. How much time does it take to pass a signal post?  
**Solution:**  
Speed = $54 \times \frac{5}{18} = 15$ m/s.  
Time = $180/15 = 12$ seconds.  
**Answer:** $\boxed{12\ \text{seconds}}$

---

### Example 2: (Passing a Platform)
**Q:** A train 200 m long passes a platform 100 m long in 24 seconds. Find the speed of the train.  
**Solution:**  
Total distance = $200 + 100 = 300$ m.  
Speed = $300/24 = 12.5$ m/s = $12.5 \times \frac{18}{5} = 45$ km/h.  
**Answer:** $\boxed{45\ \text{km/h}}$

---

### Example 3: (Two Trains, Same Direction)
**Q:** Two trains 120 m and 150 m long are running in the same direction at 60 km/h and 42 km/h. How long will the faster train take to completely pass the slower one?  
**Solution:**  
Relative speed = $(60 - 42) \times \frac{5}{18} = 5$ m/s.  
Total length = $120 + 150 = 270$ m.  
Time = $270/5 = 54$ seconds.  
**Answer:** $\boxed{54\ \text{seconds}}$

---

### Example 4: (Two Trains, Opposite Directions)
**Q:** Two trains 110 m and 90 m long run in opposite directions at 36 km/h and 54 km/h. How long will they take to cross each other?  
**Solution:**  
Relative speed = $(36 + 54) \times \frac{5}{18} = 25$ m/s.  
Total length = $110 + 90 = 200$ m.  
Time = $200/25 = 8$ seconds.  
**Answer:** $\boxed{8\ \text{seconds}}$

---

### Example 5: (Passing a Man Walking in Same Direction)
**Q:** A train 150 m long is running at 54 km/h. A man is running at 6 km/h in the same direction. How much time will the train take to pass the man?  
**Solution:**  
Relative speed = $(54 - 6) \times \frac{5}{18} = 48 \times \frac{5}{18} = 13.33$ m/s.  
Time = $150/13.33 \approx 11.25$ seconds.  
**Answer:** $\boxed{11.25\ \text{seconds}}$

---

### Example 6: (Passing a Man Walking in Opposite Direction)
**Q:** A train 200 m long is running at 60 km/h. A man walks at 6 km/h in the opposite direction. Time taken to pass the man?  
**Solution:**  
Relative speed = $(60 + 6) \times \frac{5}{18} = 66 \times \frac{5}{18} = 18.33$ m/s.  
Time = $200/18.33 \approx 10.91$ seconds.  
**Answer:** $\boxed{10.91\ \text{seconds}}$

---

### Example 7: (After Crossing, Speed Ratio)
**Q:** Two trains start at the same time from stations A and B towards each other. After crossing, they take 9 hours and 16 hours to reach B and A respectively. Find the ratio of their speeds.  
**Solution:**  
Required ratio = $\sqrt{16} : \sqrt{9} = 4:3$  
**Answer:** $\boxed{4:3}$

---

### Example 8: (Crossing a Stationary Engine)
**Q:** A train 250 m long crosses a stationary engine 50 m long in 20 seconds. Find speed of the train.  
**Solution:**  
Total length = $250 + 50 = 300$ m.  
Speed = $300/20 = 15$ m/s = $15 \times \frac{18}{5} = 54$ km/h.  
**Answer:** $\boxed{54\ \text{km/h}}$

---

### Example 9: (Time to Cross a Bridge)
**Q:** A train 120 m long is running at 36 km/h. How much time will it take to cross a bridge 180 m long?  
**Solution:**  
Speed = $36 \times \frac{5}{18} = 10$ m/s.  
Total length = $120 + 180 = 300$ m.  
Time = $300/10 = 30$ seconds.  
**Answer:** $\boxed{30\ \text{seconds}}$
