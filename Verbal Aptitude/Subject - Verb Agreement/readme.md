# Subject-Verb Agreement – Complete Notes for Verbal Aptitude (Infosys Focus)

## What is Subject-Verb Agreement?
**Subject-Verb Agreement** means the verb in a sentence must agree with its subject in number (singular or plural) and person. Correct agreement is a frequent topic in Infosys and other company verbal aptitude exams.
