## Sequence of Tenses

### Definition
When there are two or more clauses (main and subordinate) in a sentence, the tense of the verb in the subordinate clause depends on the tense of the verb in the main clause.

### Rules

1. **If Main Clause is in Present/Future,**  
   Subordinate clause can have any tense as required by the sense.
   - *He says that he is ill.* (Present)
   - *He will say that he was ill.* (Future)

2. **If Main Clause is in Past,**  
   Subordinate clause is generally in past tense too.
   - *He said that he was ill.*
   - *She said that she had finished her work.*

   **Exceptions:**
   - When the subordinate clause expresses a universal truth.
     - *The teacher said that the earth moves around the sun.*
