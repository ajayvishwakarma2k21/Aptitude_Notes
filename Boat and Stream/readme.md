# üö£ Boats and Streams ‚Äì Aptitude Notes

This guide helps you quickly revise all essential concepts, formulas, and question types for **Boats and Streams** aptitude problems. Useful for placements, competitive exams, and interviews.

## üìò Key Concepts

- **Stream (Current):** The water in a river flows at a certain speed (stream speed, denoted by `s`).
- **Still Water:** Water with no current (speed = 0).
- **Downstream:** Boat moves **with** the current.
- **Upstream:** Boat moves **against** the current.

---

## üî¢ Standard Notations

- **Speed of boat in still water:** `b` (in km/h or m/s)
- **Speed of stream:** `s` (in km/h or m/s)

---

## üìù Formulas

### 1. **Downstream Speed**
$$
\text{Downstream speed} = b + s
$$

### 2. **Upstream Speed**
$$
\text{Upstream speed} = b - s
$$

### 3. **Finding Boat and Stream Speeds**
Given downstream speed (`d`) and upstream speed (`u`):

- **Speed of boat in still water:**
  
  b = d + u / 2
  
- **Speed of stream:**
  
  s = d - u / 2
  

### 4. **Time, Distance, and Speed**
- **Distance:**  

  Distance = Speed  * Time
  
- **Time:**  
  
  Time = Distance / Speed

## üí° Basic & Moderate Example Questions

### Example 1: Calculate Downstream/Upstream Speed
**Q:** A boat travels at 10 km/h in still water. The stream speed is 2 km/h. What are the downstream and upstream speeds?

**A:**  
- Downstream: $10 + 2 = 12$ km/h  
- Upstream: $10 - 2 = 8$ km/h

---

### Example 2: Find Boat and Stream Speed
**Q:** A boat covers 30 km downstream in 3 hours and the same distance upstream in 5 hours. Find the speed of the boat in still water and the stream.

**A:**  
- Downstream speed = $30/3 = 10$ km/h  
- Upstream speed = $30/5 = 6$ km/h  
- Boat speed = $(10 + 6)/2 = 8$ km/h  
- Stream speed = $(10 - 6)/2 = 2$ km/h

---

### Example 3: Time to Cover a Distance (Down & Up)
**Q:** A man rows at 6 km/h in still water. If the stream runs at 2 km/h, how long for him to row 24 km downstream and return?

**A:**  
- Downstream speed = $6 + 2 = 8$ km/h  
- Upstream speed = $6 - 2 = 4$ km/h  
- Time downstream = $24/8 = 3$ hours  
- Time upstream = $24/4 = 6$ hours  
- **Total time = 3 + 6 = 9 hours**

---

### Example 4: Stream Speed from Time Difference
**Q:** A boat goes 50 km downstream in 5 hr and returns in 10 hr. Find speed of stream.

**A:**  
- Downstream speed = $50/5 = 10$ km/h  
- Upstream speed = $50/10 = 5$ km/h  
- Stream speed = $(10 - 5)/2 = 2.5$ km/h

---

### Example 5: Ratio Based
**Q:** The ratio of speed of boat in still water to speed of stream is 3:1. If boat goes 36 km downstream in 3 hr, what is speed of stream?

**A:**  
- Downstream speed = $36/3 = 12$ km/h  
- Let speed of boat = $3x$, stream = $x$  
- $3x + x = 12 \implies 4x = 12 \implies x = 3$ km/h  
- Stream speed = $3$ km/h

---

## üèÜ Difficult/Advanced Example Questions

### Example 6: Complex Time Calculation
**Q:** A boat takes twice as long to row a distance upstream as to row the same distance downstream. If the speed of the stream is 4 km/h, what is the speed of the boat in still water?

**A:**  
- Let distance = $d$, speed of boat = $b$  
- Downstream speed = $b+4$, upstream speed = $b-4$  
- Downstream time = $d/(b+4)$, upstream time = $d/(b-4)$  
- Given: $d/(b-4) = 2 \times d/(b+4)$  
- $1/(b-4) = 2/(b+4)$  
- Cross-multiplied: $b+4 = 2b-8$  
- $b = 12$ km/h

---

### Example 7: Variable Time Difference
**Q:** A man can row 12 km downstream in 3 hours and the same distance upstream in 4 hours. How far could he row in still water in 1 hour?

**A:**  
- Downstream speed = $12/3 = 4$ km/h  
- Upstream speed = $12/4 = 3$ km/h  
- Speed in still water = $(4+3)/2 = 3.5$ km/h  
- **Distance in 1 hour = 3.5 km**

---

### Example 8: Changing Current
**Q:** In one hour, a boat goes 11 km along the stream and 5 km against the stream. Find the speed of the boat in still water and speed of the stream.

**A:**  
- Let $b$ = speed of boat, $s$ = speed of stream  
- $b+s = 11$ km/h  
- $b-s = 5$ km/h  
- Add: $2b = 16 \implies b = 8$ km/h  
- Subtract: $2s = 6 \implies s = 3$ km/h

---

### Example 9: Upstream and Downstream Time Given
**Q:** A boat can go 40 km downstream in 4 hours and the same distance upstream in 8 hours. What is the speed of the stream?

**A:**  
- Downstream speed = $40/4 = 10$ km/h  
- Upstream speed = $40/8 = 5$ km/h  
- Speed of stream = $(10-5)/2 = 2.5$ km/h

---

### Example 10: Trip with Different Downstream/Upstream Distances
**Q:** A boat covers a certain distance downstream in 2 hours and returns upstream in 2.5 hours. If the speed of the stream is 4 km/h, find the speed of the boat in still water.

**A:**  
- Let the distance (one way) = $d$  
- Downstream speed = $d/2$, upstream speed = $d/2.5$  
- $b+s = d/2$, $b-s = d/2.5$  
- $s = 4$  
- $b = \frac{d}{2} - 4 = \frac{d}{2.5} + 4$  
- Set equal: $\frac{d}{2} - 4 = \frac{d}{2.5} + 4$  
- $\frac{d}{2} - \frac{d}{2.5} = 8$  
- $d (\frac{1}{2} - \frac{2}{5}) = 8$  
- $d(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{2}{5}) = d(\frac{5-4}{10}) = d(\frac{1}{10}) = 8$  
- $d = 80$  
- Downstream speed = $80/2 = 40$ km/h  
- $b = 40 - 4 = 36$ km/h

**Tips:**  
- Always use consistent units (either km/h or m/s).
- For more challenging questions, set equations carefully and solve step by step.
- Read the question carefully to decide whether to use downstream or upstream formulas.
